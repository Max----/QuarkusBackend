# test Project

This project uses Quarkus, the Supersonic Subatomic Java Framework.

If you want to learn more about Quarkus, please visit its website: https://quarkus.io/ .

## Running the application in dev mode

You can run your application in dev mode that enables live coding using:
```shell script
./mvnw compile quarkus:dev
```

> **_NOTE:_**  Quarkus now ships with a Dev UI, which is available in dev mode only at http://localhost:8080/q/dev/.

## Packaging and running the application

The application can be packaged using:
```shell script
./mvnw package
```
It produces the `quarkus-run.jar` file in the `target/quarkus-app/` directory.
Be aware that it’s not an _über-jar_ as the dependencies are copied into the `target/quarkus-app/lib/` directory.

The application is now runnable using `java -jar target/quarkus-app/quarkus-run.jar`.

If you want to build an _über-jar_, execute the following command:
```shell script
./mvnw package -Dquarkus.package.type=uber-jar
```

The application, packaged as an _über-jar_, is now runnable using `java -jar target/*-runner.jar`.

## Creating a native executable

You can create a native executable using: 
```shell script
./mvnw package -Pnative
```

Or, if you don't have GraalVM installed, you can run the native executable build in a container using: 
```shell script
./mvnw package -Pnative -Dquarkus.native.container-build=true
```

You can then execute your native executable with: `./target/test-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner`

Issues with packaging on Windows
The Microsoft Native Tools for Visual Studio must first be initialized before packaging. You can do this by starting the x64 Native Tools Command Prompt that was installed with the Visual Studio Build Tools. At x64 Native Tools Command Prompt you can navigate to your project folder and run mvnw package -Pnative.

If you want to learn more about building native executables, please consult https://quarkus.io/guides/maven-tooling.

## Maxime's Doc

### TODO:
* Turn reactive to blocking and fix /paths *DONE*

* Mix Api entre openapi et api generée *DONE*

* Utiliser la generation d'interfaces *DONE*

* Mettre une DB en MangoDB *DONE*

* Evaluer Speed + ram usage of native

* Compare avec Spring native

* Micronaut ??

### Findings

Generating Interface stubs with `openapi-generator-maven-plugin` has proven doable for non reactive services, using `jaxrs-spec` as generator  with options `<additionalProperties>interfaceOnly=true,useSwaggerAnnotations=false</additionalProperties>` but to use Quarkus reactive features no generator provide a usable stub. 
* `jaxrs-resteasy` generates with many outdated imports, the pom.xml had to incorporate:
```xml
<dependency>
      <groupId>io.swagger</groupId>
      <artifactId>swagger-annotations</artifactId>
      <version>1.5.24</version>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>io.swagger</groupId>
      <artifactId>swagger-jaxrs</artifactId>
      <version>1.6.3</version>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>javax.servlet</groupId>
      <artifactId>javax.servlet-api</artifactId>
      <version>4.0.1</version>
      <scope>provided</scope>
    </dependency>
```
* Before running into even more import problems due to outdated libraries. At that point I stopped. I think the problem come from the generator creating an entire java servlet instead of just interfaces and all libraries being outdated in the servlet, like last update 2016 outdated. I did not find an option to create just interfaces.
* `jaxrs-jersey` has the same problems
* `jaxrs-cxf` has the same problems
* `jaxrs-spec` works due to being able to generate just the interfaces, but only with non-reactive objects.

A definitive way to generate code would be to create a branch of the generator and make our own small modification.

I have trouble with mongoDB not properly working, but this has to do with my lack of experience at setting up application properties and not with quarkus. Same deal with MapStruct I struggled with dependancy injections and ended up quickly manually implementing them. Both libraries do work as expected with quarkus, with exensive proof online.

### Evaluating peformance

Start a postgres db in the official docker image with:

```docker run -d --name myPostgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=pass -p 5432:5432 postgres```

Same for the MongoDb docker image except we need a replica set mongo image due to using transactions.
* First create a dockerfile with

```
FROM mongo:latest
RUN echo "rs.initiate();" > /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/replica-init.js
CMD [ "--replSet", "rs" ]
```

Build this dockerfile with `docker build ./ -t mongo:latest-replset` then run it:

```docker run -d --name myMongo -p 27017:27017 mongo:latest-replset```

Then

| --- | --- | --- | ---
| Jar | 1.8 | 1.1MB but 110MB JVM | 40.3MB
| Fat Jar | 2.042 | 1.1 MB but 150MB JVM | 40.7MB
| Native | 0.674 | 44MB | 87.9 MB
